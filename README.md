<h1>Netflix vs Going to the movies.</h1>
<p>Hello my name is John,I am pro Netflix completely. My reasons for choosing Netflix over going to the movies are , that you dont have to leave the confort of your own home, movies are very costly if you go with a partner. with the ticket cost and the snacks and the transportation if you do not live close can all add up. If you love movies and you take time to set up your home to enjoy them movies at home is a better choice.  .</p>
